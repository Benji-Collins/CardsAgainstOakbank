# CardsAgainstOakbank
Cards Against Oakbank is a clone of [ajanata/PretendYoureXyzzy](https://github.com/ajanata/PretendYoureXyzzy), which in turn is a game based off of Cards Against Humanity.

Cards Against Oakbank was simply made for my personal use. All license terms are exactly the same as the original project by ajanata. All original files/source code can be found on ajanata's repo.

If you plan on using this repo for your own use, check the wiki pages (coming soon) for the correct commands for database install and building.

You can play/test this game [here](http://cah.sneakysneaky.tk) but I can't make any guarantees as to whether it will work or not.

Please dont make any pull requests/issues here as this is an unofficial fork/clone. Please had to the original repo for that.
