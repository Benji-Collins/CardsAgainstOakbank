# CardsAgainstOriginality
Cards Against Originality is a clone of [ajanata/PretendYoureXyzzy](https://github.com/ajanata/PretendYoureXyzzy), which in turn is a game based off of Cards Against Humanity.

---

Cards Against Originality was simply made for my personal use. All license terms are exactly the same as the original project by ajanata. All original files/source code can be found on ajanata's repo.

If you plan on using this repo for your own use, check the wiki pages for the correct commands for database install and building.

What does this fork have that the original repo doesn't?

- Dark theme
- Cleaner UI
- Message notifications
- Small resolution alert
- Shorter CardCast command
- Better in-game CardCast instructions
- More complete install instructions in wiki

You can play/test this game [here](http://cardsagainstoriginality.tk) but I can't make any guarantees as to whether it will work or not.

If you have an issue that you know is related to the changes I've made (dark theme etc.) then feel free to make an issue here if you want to. If you have an issue related to the core game files/functions, please make the issue on the original PYX repo. Thanks.
